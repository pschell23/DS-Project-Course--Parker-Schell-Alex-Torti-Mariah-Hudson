    "Question: We aim to investigate whether data science techniques can denote countries sharing similar characteristics in terms of both food prices and nutritional value indices via a xgBoost ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Signifcance: This research question addresses global challenges related to nutrition, food security, and sustainable development. The outcomes have the potential to guide the formulation of evidence-based policies, promoting better access to nutritious food and enhancing the well-being of the world.\n",

    "Background: The Food Prices for Nutrition database integrates data from the International Comparison Program, food composition databases, and diverse nutritional sources, offering a comprehensive perspective on healthy diet economics across 176 countries from 2017-2021. Through our research, we decided to choose the variable \"Percent of the population who cannot afford a healthy diet [CoHD_headcount]\" as our target variable in order to assess the likelihood of food scarcity in specific nations. This metric serves as a key indicator for addressing global challenges related to nutrition accessibility and affordability. When finding our initial dataset on World Bank, we noticed that many countries lacked data after 2017, which could be due to the state that country is in and potentially the lack of data on more specific/obscure variables. To address this, we added 11 columns of more straightforward variables (also from World Bank), such as percentage of population under the poverty line. In doing this we aim to create a more accurate model due to these variables lower amount of NAs. Additionally all of the variables, original and later added ones, were selected due to their perceived relevance to the issue that we are aiming to address and have some sort of tie to lack of proper diet."
